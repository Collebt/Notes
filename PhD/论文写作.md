*The matching of two point sets is a permutation problem*.





### matching

The semantic keypoints matching approach matches the semantic keypoints in different instances of the same category of objects, while the geometric matching matches the keypoints on different images of the same scene and does not consider high-level semantic infor mation.





### ICP

Rigid point cloud registration is a
chicken-and-egg problem that requires solving for both un
known
point correspondences and rigid transformation to
align the point clouds, and is thus commonly known as
the simultaneous pose and correspondence problem



### GNN

The existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches can only maintain permutation-invariance, failing to guarantee invariance with respect to other transformations.
